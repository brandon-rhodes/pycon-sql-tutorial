PYTHON SQL KOANS
================

Python SQL Koans is inspired by Python Koans (https://bitbucket.org/mcrute/python_koans) 
which, in turn, was inspired by Edgecase's Ruby Koans (http://rubykoans.com/ )

This in an interactive tutorial for learning to use SQL with Python.  It uses an sqlite3
database for the example. Those with bitter experience know that Oracle, DB2, MySQL, 
Postgres all have syntax idiosyncrazies [sic] but effort is made here for the SQL to be
interchangeable.  

Most tests are 'fixed' by filling the missing parts of assert functions. Eg:

    self.assertEqual(__, 1+2)

which can be fixed by replacing the __ part with the appropriate code:
