SQL for Python Developers
=========================

This repository contains all of the materials
that go with my 2012 PyCon tutorial “SQL For Python Developers”
which is on YouTube:

The movie database used in the tutorial was assembled from the
[IMDB’s non-commercial data files](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)
using scripts in the `bin/` directory,
but I haven’t tested whether they still work.
